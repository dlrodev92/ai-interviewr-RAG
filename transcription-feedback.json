      { "interviewer": "Oh, um… so does that mean… you can, like, change a variable’s type on the fly?" },

      { "interviewer": "Oh… okay. So… uh, do all errors go through try-catch?" },
      { "candidate": "No, only exceptions do. Traditional PHP errors, like warnings or notices, don’t trigger exceptions unless error handling is configured to do so, such as using `set_error_handler()`." }

      { "interviewer": "Ah, right… so… um… is PDO better than… um… MySQLi?" },

      { "interviewer": "Oh… so… do you, uh, always need a framework?" },

      { "interviewer": "Can you give an example of a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle?" },

      { "interviewer": "Oh, so… is it like a virtual machine?" },
      { "candidate": "Not exactly. Docker uses containerization, which shares the host OS kernel instead of running a full OS like VMs. This makes containers lightweight and faster to start." }

      { "interviewer": "Do microservices always improve scalability?" },
      { "candidate": "Not always. While microservices allow horizontal scaling, they add complexity in terms of deployment, inter-service communication, and data consistency." }

      { "interviewer": "Okay… but wouldn’t that block some users?" },
      { "candidate": "Yes, if they exceed the limit. However, APIs often return `429 Too Many Requests`, and we can implement exponential backoff to handle retries more gracefully." }

      { "interviewer": "So escaping input isn’t enough?" },
      { "candidate": "No, escaping can help, but it's not foolproof. Prepared statements are more secure because they separate data from SQL logic." }
